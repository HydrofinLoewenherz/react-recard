# Recard

The app keeps track of the learning progress and shows responsive graphs for it.

## Authors

The project was created by [Rico (uozjn)][rico-github] and [Paul Wagner (ujhtl)][paul-github].

## Notes

The app icon is the Material-UI `Styles` icon. We do not own that icon, it is simply the chosen placeholder for this app
as it is not used commercially.
